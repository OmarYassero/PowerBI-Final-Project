## 🧠 Project Vision

This project is a **fully interactive Power BI analytics system** created to explore, analyze, and visualize structured data across multiple dimensions.

It is designed to:

* Reveal hidden patterns
* Support data-driven decisions
* Provide fast, visual understanding of complex datasets

The dashboard is structured as a **multi-page analytical experience**, not just a single report.

## 🏗 Project Architecture

The report contains **4 analytical pages**, each designed for a specific purpose:

| Page             | Visuals   | Purpose                              |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Overview**     | 4 visuals | High-level KPIs and summary insights |
| **Demographics** | 4 visuals | Population / user breakdowns         |
| **Page 3**       | 2 visuals | Deep-dive analysis                   |
| **Page 1**       | 3 visuals | Supporting metrics & comparisons     |

Each page is built using Power BI’s native visual engine with interactive filtering and cross-highlighting.
